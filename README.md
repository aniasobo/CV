I became a developer because I love solving problems, making things work and automating the hard parts of life. Hi!  
  
My professional adventures in tech started with a QA Tester job at an e-commerce product company. I then made my way to a busy digital agency, switching from desktop products to applications designed for mobile devices of all kinds.  
  
While working within an Agile team of developers, designers and product owners, I caught the UX bug and moved on to the 3rd sector to spend more time researching users and ways to reach them. My desire to make things happen is what subsequently led me to coding.

### Cross-team Agile experience

My professional background includes a variety of roles within Agile teams.

- 5+ years of hands-on Quality Assurance experience.
- 5 years of UX/user research and web content experience.
- Familiarity with all stages of product development, from discovery and user research, through design and development to test strategy and implementation.
- Good business sense, acquired in close proximity to Clients, Product Owners and IT Directors.

### Fast, self-directed learner

I love being a Jane of many trades and finding unexpected connections between unrelated things.

- For my final Makers project, I picked up Python - a programming language previously unknown to me - and started TDDing in it within 2 days.
- Known for spearheading constant process improvement in all my previous jobs.
- Early adopter, techno-optimist, hardware tinkerer.

### Product company, digital agency and NGO experience

I worked in organisations of vastly different types, structures and dynamics, and thrived in all of them.

- Product company: I was the sole QA at an e-commerce website, responsible for the long-term testing strategy and automation. 
- Agency: I worked on a portfolio of mobile applications at a busy digital agency, in close proximity with both the team and external stakeholders.
- Third sector: my NGO experience taught me to work within tight budgets, make good cases for the use of certain tools and most of all - to listen to users and to be their advocate.   
- Freelance work: occassional but steady freelance work has taught me the discipline necessary for being effective while being remote, and sharpened my time-management skills.
