I became a developer because I love solving problems, making things work and automating the hard parts of life. Hi!  
  
My professional adventures in tech started with a QA Tester job at an e-commerce product company. I then made my way to a busy digital agency, switching from desktop products to applications designed for mobile devices of all kinds.  
  
While working within an Agile team of developers, designers and product owners, I caught the UX bug and moved on to the 3rd sector to spend more time researching users and ways to reach them. My desire to make things happen is what subsequently led me to coding.
